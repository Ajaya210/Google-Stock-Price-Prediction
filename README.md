## Project Title:
**Stock Price Prediction Using ARIMA and SARIMAX**

## Project Summary:
Stock price prediction is a crucial aspect of financial markets, helping investors make informed decisions. This project focuses on predicting Google stock prices using time series analysis techniques such as ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMAX (Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving-Average with Exogenous Regressors). By leveraging historical stock price data, the project aims to provide accurate and reliable stock price forecasts.

## Goal of the Project:
To develop a predictive model that accurately forecasts Google stock prices using ARIMA and SARIMAX models, aiding investors in making informed decisions.

## Process:
### Data Collection:
- Gathered historical stock price data for Google.
- The dataset includes daily stock prices, trading volumes, and other relevant financial indicators.

### Data Preprocessing:
- Cleaned the data, handled missing values, and transformed the data into a suitable format for time series analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualized stock price trends, seasonality, and patterns using graphs and charts.

### Model Selection and Training:
- Employed ARIMA and SARIMAX models for time series forecasting.
- Performed hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

### Evaluation Metrics:
- Assessed the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

## Details of the Features:
- **Date**: The date of the stock price.
- **Open**: The opening price of the stock.
- **High**: The highest price of the stock during the trading day.
- **Low**: The lowest price of the stock during the trading day.
- **Close**: The closing price of the stock.
- **Volume**: The number of shares traded during the trading day.

## Skills Used:
- **Programming**: Python
- **Data Manipulation and Aggregation**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Time Series Analysis**: ARIMA, SARIMAX
- **Evaluation**: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
